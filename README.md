## You can't hold it!

Hyperpass is a game made during the DAE 2020-2021 Easter gamejam. Compete as one of two teams and claim the ball as yours! Beware, you can't hold it for long and as soon as you try to pass it to your friend the other team might snatch it from you in a never-ending (for 3 minutes at least) game of cat and mouse.


The game is meant to be played with a controller and support local multiplayer with up to 4 people. A Build can be found & downloaded [here](https://elfiann.itch.io/hyper-ball)
